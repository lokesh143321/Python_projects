Implemented hands-on with Object-oriented;
Ship of fools Game and  Client-server application.
 
1. Edge detection (project-1)
   For edge detection,the input image is typically converted to grayscale. An 8-bit grayscale image represents a pixel using one value (between 0 and 255).
    1. Read the input image file and convert it to 8-bit grayscale format
    2.Add dummy pixels with a value of 0 along the image boundary, so that the 3x3 mask does not fall outside the actual image.
    a. Call a function flatten() (to be implemented by you), which takes as input a 2D list or a 2D tuple, and returns a 1D list.
    b. Set the new value by appropriately indexing new pixel values. Re-member that the 2D list new pixel values does not has dummy pixels.
 
 2. Ship of fools (project-2)
    Ship of Fools is a simple classic dice game. It is played with five standard 6-faced dice by two or more players.
    The player with the highest cargo score wins the round.So it continues how many rounds the two players wants to play. In this project I gained knowledge on oops(object oriented programmng 
    language. 

 3. Clent-server (project-3)
    Created a python based Client Server application where the server receives and handles the request from the client.
    The concepts like OOP, Async I/O, Error Handling, Exceptions, Testing, TCP/IP were used.
